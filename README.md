# VenuePro (n8n + Postgres)

VenuePro is a booking CRM built on **n8n workflows** with a **PostgreSQL** backend. You manage and operate the CRM through the **n8n web UI** (browser-based HTML interface): create/edit workflows, run automations, and view execution history—while data is stored in Postgres.
